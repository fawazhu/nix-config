# TODO
 - Automate bluetooth setup.
 - Automate printer setup.
 - Automate kde connect setup.
 - See if I can use flakes more effectively.
 - Setup additional (guest) users.
 - See if I can restore the state of the firefox flatpak. Perhaps by already logging in.
 - Import ssh public key and private key (via secret).
 - See if I can setup libreoffice in tabbed mode initially.
